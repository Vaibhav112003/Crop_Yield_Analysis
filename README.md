Crop Yield Prediction and Optimization
This project focuses on predicting crop yields in India using machine learning techniques and a dataset covering agricultural data from 1997 to 2020. By analyzing various agronomic factors such as weather conditions, soil type, and fertilizer usage, the project aims to forecast crop yields and provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing agricultural practices.

Project Features
Data-Driven Predictions: The project utilizes historical agricultural data to predict crop yields across different states in India. The dataset includes 19698 rows with 10 columns, covering various factors influencing crop yields.

Machine Learning Models: Advanced machine learning algorithms are employed to create accurate predictive models. The models consider multiple agronomic variables to deliver reliable yield predictions.

Interactive Streamlit Application: An easy-to-use Streamlit web application is developed to allow users to input specific parameters and obtain crop yield predictions along with recommendations for improving agricultural outcomes.

Optimized Solutions: The project offers actionable recommendations for optimizing resource allocation, crop management, and risk mitigation, with the goal of enhancing agricultural productivity and sustainability.
